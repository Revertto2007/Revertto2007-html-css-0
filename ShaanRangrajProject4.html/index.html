            <h1>A Review of HTML</h1>
               <p>HTML is a very simple scripting language. It consists of ordinary text, with elements that are enclosed by "<" and ">" characters.
                    <br>The best part about HTML is that once we know how to effectively use basic elements, we can look up how to use all of the others!</p>
