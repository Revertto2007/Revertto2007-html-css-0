                This book brings you into the midst of the Third German Reich during the Nazi realm, and depicts the harsh reality of life that a young Jewish boxer would have to face at this discriminative time, with the need to hide the real
                identity of himself.
                <br />
                This book deserves a five star rating as a result of the amazing depiction of an individual that is Jewish in the midst of the Third German Reich. <br />
                This story however brings you into the eyes of a boxer that is Jewish, and one that hides their identity from being Jewish, in the face of sports.

                If I could give this amazing piece of literature a better rating than five stars, I would. <br />
                This book is an amazing book that brings you in the eyes of three individuals escaping from the emblem of discrimination, violence, and political repression. <br />These three individuals bring you in the eyes of three different
                crisis, from different time periods and different regimes. <br />The individual all strive to meet a common goal, which is to meet liberty at itâ€™s eyes, and eventually two of these individuals coming together.
