            <p>This book brings you into the midst of the Third German Reich during the Nazi realm, and depicts the harsh reality of life that a young Jewish boxer would have to face at this discriminative time, with the need to hide the real identity of himself. This book deserves a five star rating as a result of the amazing depiction of an individual that is Jewish in the midst of the Third German Reich, however bringing you into the eyes of a boxer that is Jewish, and one that hides their identity from being Jewish, in the face of sports.</p>

            <p>If I could give this amazing piece of literature a better rating than five stars, I would. This book is an amazing book that brings you in the eyes of three individuals escaping from the emblem of discrimination, violence, and political repression. These three individuals bring you in the eyes of three different crisis’s, from different time periods and different regimes. The individual all strive to meet a common goal, which is to meet liberty at it’s eyes, and eventually two of these individuals coming together.</p>
